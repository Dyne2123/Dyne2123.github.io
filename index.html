        <p>A programming language is a computer language that is used by programmers (developers) to communicate with computers. It is a set of instructions written in any specific language ( C, C++, Java, Python) to perform a specific task.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Although many languages share similarities, each has its own syntax. Once a programmer learns the languages rules, syntax, and structure, they write the source code in a text editor or IDE. Then, the programmer often compiles the code into machine language that can be understood by the computer. Scripting languages, which do not require a compiler, use an interpreter to execute the script.</p>

        <h1>1. python</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Python has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world in recent years. It's used in everything from machine learning to building websites and software testing. It can be used by developers and non-developers alike.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Python is developed under an OSI-approved open source license. Hence, it is completely free to use, even for commercial purposes. It doesn't cost anything to download Python or to include it in your application. It can also be freely modified and re-distributed</p>
        <br>
        <p>Python has an extensive standard library available for anyone to use. This means that programmers don't have to write their code for every single thing unlike other programming languages. There are libraries for image manipulation, databases, unit-testing, expressions and a lot of other functionalities. In addition to the standard library, there is also a growing collection of thousands of components, which are all available in the Python Package Index.</p>

        <h1>2. java</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Java is a multi-purpose language backend/server-side programming language that revolves around the concepts of objects and classes. It is popularly used in web, console, GUI, mobile applications, and game development.</p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Java is designed to enable the development of portable, high-performance applications for the widest range of computing platforms possible, hence enabling the fundamental tenets of overarching accessibility as well as cross-platform interaction. By making applications available across heterogeneous environments, businesses can provide more services, boost end-user productivity, communication, and collaboration, and dramatically reduce the ownership cost of enterprise and consumer applications.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Java is still a relevant programming language that shows no sign of declining in popularity and, for that reason, is worth learning. Most developers pick it up as their first programming language because it's reasonably easy to learn</p>

        <h1>3. HTML</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
